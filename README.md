These are programs from the free eBook

by Jonathan Bartlett.

These programs are targeted at Linux and assembled for 32-bit Intel registers. 32-bit Intel is now dated but these programs serve pedagogical purposes.

Each program is in a folder (e.g. 01-exit). Within each folder is the source code and a makefile. Simply run the makefile to build the program. 
Type: `echo $?` in order to see the output as most of the programs do not write to standard output.
